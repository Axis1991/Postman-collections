Here are a few of SOAP and REST reuqests - SOAP from public API's and REST following the course "Postman API Test Automation for Beginners" by Valentin Despa - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp5Jh2FIpF0&t=4950s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org.

I used Postman variables and JavaScript for some basic assertions, learn about automatic runs and integrated my collection in a CI/CD Github actions workflow, for which I have claimed a Postman API Test Automation badge.
